# dotfiles

My dotfiles, managed with [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

I've been recreating the whole setup from scratch after years of having abandoned my old setup, archived in the [retired](/fmoliveira/dotfiles/tree/retired) branch for reference and nostalgia. I'm making no haste with this new setup and instead decided to deliberately revisit my whole workflow bit by bit with a strong focus on reducing mental overhead, which is why I'm rechecking only a small portion of my former setup at a time and also taking the time to introduce new tools to my environment.
