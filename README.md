# dotfiles

My dotfiles, managed with [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

This is currently the third iteration of my dotfiles setup which I'm recreating from scratch without any heavy reuse from my previous configurations. I'm making no haste and decided to deliberately revisit my whole workflow in detail with a strong focus on reducing mental overhead, which is why I'm not even exploring many tools right away.

## Retired iterations

The older unmaintained versions of my dotfiles are preserved for archival purposes in the following tags:

- [v2-macos-catalina](https://github.com/fmoliveira/dotfiles/tree/v2-macos-catalina)
- [v1-debian-jessie](https://github.com/fmoliveira/dotfiles/tree/v1-debian-jessie)
